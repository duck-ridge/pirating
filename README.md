***how chain constructed***  

Each player appoints other players or the Treasure Island as the target for each turn.  

As the real battlefield, the game can be pretty unpredictable until all actions are revealed.  

**Crashed:**    
One of the most common situations is when more than 1 player appoints the same target. In this case, these pirate crash together, and their actions will not be effective. Besides, crashes not only make these pirates loot nothing but also make these pirates become extremely vulnerable, which means crashed pirates will lose all their treasure if they are attacked.  

Whereas Treasure Island is an exemption, every pirate who chooses Treasure Island as the target can take 1 treasure without disturbance and risk.  

**Chain:**  
Chain is prevalent. When A -> B -> C, the chain is formed. The outcome depends on whether the terminal successfully gets anything.  
If C gets treasure from somewhere else e.g. treasure island, C can still keep the stored treasure whereas the newly looted treasure goes upstream to A. Players like B are in the middle of the chain and get nothing. If C loots nothing for some reason like crashed, all treasure goes upstream.  


**Switch:**  
The switch happened when two pirates appointed each other as the target. In this case, their stored treasure is exchanged.  

**Loop:**  
Loop is another common situation. It is a close circle for example: A -> B -> C -> A. All treasures among A, B, and C will not be changed.
